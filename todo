global:
* dwelling is subset of furnishing
add to tile service; show only possible locations for tile based on current and future locations

terminal:
split list of tiles into sections
show only possible effects -- those that the player already has, and those which could be gained using tile effects

bugs:
* do not get extra food for placing tiles over water tiles
* tile placement shows u for tiles only accessible with tile effect
 - also suggests you might be able to place a tile on the starting dwelling
* trying to do something impossible still increments player count, should probably give you a second choice
* tiles are already built when they're not
* if there's no valid place to build a tile, the keyboard human player service throws up
* weekly market action output seems like it's not actually requiring the constraints pass? weird.
* place a single tile doesn't reset

nice to haves:
* changing the location to build could change the location map to highlight the currently chosen location
* should probably warn if you try and do an action that you're not expected to be able to do
 - cant sow, no resources
 - cant build, no space
 - cant expore, no weapon
* tell the player which way they are placing tiles
* when playing with a physical board, needs to be able to specify which card has been revealled
* no way of seeing where tiles are
