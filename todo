global:
* dwelling is subset of furnishing
add to tile service; show only possible locations for tile based on current and future locations

terminal:
split list of tiles into sections
show only possible effects -- those that the player already has, and those which could be gained using tile effects

bugs:
tile placement shows u for tiles only accessible with tile effect
 - also suggests you might be able to place a tile on the starting dwelling
trying to do something impossible still increments player count, should probably give you a second choice
